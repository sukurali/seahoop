         <h2>Purpose</h2>
         <p>SeaHoop’s founder was a basketball lover, like every other basketball player, he has always dreamed of playing in front of millions of people around the globe on television. But his basketball dream was destroyed when he got into an accident which caused him permanent disability in his leg. From elementary school basketball to high school varsity basketball, he has always been frustrated with being unable to predict where and when a pickup basketball game will happen. This has caused him a significant amount of time, and effort. After receiving the news that he is most likely never returning to the sport he loves at a competitive level, he decided to do something for the basketball community in Seattle. The sport that gave him lifelong friends, family, and life lessons.</p>
